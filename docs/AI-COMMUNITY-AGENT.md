  id: string;
  name: string;
  joinedAt: Date;
  roles: string[];
  contributions: number;
  reputation: number;
  interests: string[];
  skills: string[];
  connections: string[];
  activityLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  sentimentScore: number;
}

interface SocialNetwork {
  nodes: NetworkNode[];
  edges: NetworkEdge[];
  clusters: NetworkCluster[];
  metrics: NetworkMetrics;
}

interface GroupDynamics {
  cohesion: number;
  diversity: number;
  conflictLevel: number;
  collaborationIndex: number;
  leadershipDistribution: number;
  communicationFlow: number;
  trends: DynamicTrend[];
}
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { CommunityAgent } from './agents/community.js';

// Initialize with AI configuration
const agent = new CommunityAgent({
  name: 'AI Community Coordinator',
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
  temperature: 0.7
});

// Start the agent
await agent.start();

// Plan an AI-optimized event
const eventPlan = await agent.processMessage({
  type: 'query',
  content: {
    topic: 'event-planning',
    data: {
      name: 'Community Innovation Fair',
      type: 'mixed',
      goals: ['showcase talents', 'foster connections']
    }
  }
});

// Analyze social network
const networkInsights = await agent.processMessage({
  type: 'query',
  content: {
    topic: 'network-analysis',
    data: { focus: 'connection opportunities' }
  }
});
```
