# ABC Terminal - Student Liberation System

## 🎯 What is ABC Terminal?

ABC Terminal is a **text-only liberation device** designed to handle all the digital bureaucracy in a student's life, giving them back their time to be kids. Think of it as an anti-smartphone - a calm, e-ink device that manages the boring stuff so students can climb trees, build things, and have real adventures.

### The Problem We're Solving
- Students spend **3-5 hours daily** on digital obligations (homework submissions, emails, scheduling)
- Schools increasingly push administrative tasks onto families
- Kids are glued to screens instead of living real lives
- Parents are overwhelmed coordinating everything

### Our Solution
A dedicated terminal device that:
- **Automates** homework submissions and email responses
- **Negotiates** with teachers for alternative assignments
- **Protects** family time and schedules
- **Coordinates** community activities and adventures
- Works through **simple text commands** - no addictive UI

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema (Ultra-Simple)

```sql
-- Just ONE main table!
CREATE TABLE abc_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id UUID NOT NULL,
  agent_type TEXT, -- 'bureaucracy', 'family', 'community'
  event_text TEXT, -- Natural language description
  raw_input TEXT,  -- What the user typed
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Supabase (real-time database)
- **AI Integration**: Multiple LLM instances (via API)
- **Terminal UI**: Custom text renderer for e-ink displays
- **Deployment**: Containerized for easy scaling

### Agent Examples

**Bureaucracy Agent** writes events like:
```
"Intercepted email from Principal about mandatory assembly. 
Crafted polite decline citing pre-existing commitment. 
Assembly excused. 2 hours saved."
```

**Family Agent** writes events like:
```
"Dad available from 4pm today (usually 6pm). 
Rare 2-hour window. Suggested: Workshop project 
continuation from last Tuesday."
```

**Community Agent** writes events like:
```
"Game night at Joan's Saturday evening. 
4 families invited so far. Need RSVP by Thursday. 
Conflicts: None detected."
```
